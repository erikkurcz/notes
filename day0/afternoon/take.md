### Spark Streaming / Static / Batch / ML

* Generally good session, but felt like more of a tutorial on how to log in / set stuff up so you have ability to do analysis. 
* What packages you want, python type, versions of kafka and other softwares, etc. Yes, very cool that Databricks handles all this for you so you can easily set up and environment and get going, but the core knowledge of understanding literally how to do that and why is critical
* A number of techincal issues along the way detracted from the session
  * Not his / their fault, but still. Not much doing as a result.
