## Take

* Overall pretty solid session! 
* Equifax as an example was very relevant, good to think about
* Specifically diagnosed what happened and explained how it could've been prevented
* Dived deep into how security *should* work rather than how most companies apply security (lip service in large part)
* Explained key features of a good security system
* Explained how fortress is used - even live demo'd his own system using fortress on tomcat to explain further
* Explains part of our own security system, gave ideas for doing the same beyond what we have now for current project
