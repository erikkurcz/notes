## Business Problem
* How to build system for analyzing streaming click and orders data

## Databricks on Azure
* Databricks itself is backend-agnostic, doesn't matter if it's Azure or AWS, etc
* Basically you log in and use notebooks / Spark for analysis and storage, likewise vizualization
* Generally good session, but this is really more a tutorial on how to log in / set stuff up so you have ability to do analysis. 
  * What packages you want, python type, versions of kafka and other softwares, etc. Yes, very cool that Databricks handles all this for you so you can easily set up and environment and get going, but the core knowledge of understanding literally how to do that and why is critical
