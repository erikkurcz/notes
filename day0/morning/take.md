## Scala + Spark session

* Awesome session
* Took people from base linux environment to installing java, scala, and spark
* Thereafter explained differences between Java and Scala, why use scala over python for spark jobs
* Plenty of well-documented examples with corresponding code
* Then moved into some light data manipulation using spark and displaying provenance on UI
* Coolest part was probably SQL-language over dataframes in spark
  * The query language we all know, with datastructures we just built

* Admittedly was scrambling to install everything but it's mostly because I'm new to this and haven't partitioned drive yet. Literally USB-booting ubuntu and installing as I go, so I learned a lot on installation / setup from this then got a good understanding of scala and spark thereafter
