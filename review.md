# TODO

## Culture
* Satya Nadella's *Hit Refresh*
* Culture chat, standards for testing, documentation, etc need to be clear
* Discuss different formats for storage and test in house - Parquet/ORC, various compression formats. Certain projects already diving into this which is good, but should be more common

## Analysis
* Spark for analysis and connecting into kafka
* MXNET for misc neural net applications

## Movement
* Gobblin vs existing means to move data to/from diff types of DBs

## DBs
* Calcite for query and data optimization
* Drill for project queries into nested json + tying back to relational schemas

## Misc
* Apache blog
