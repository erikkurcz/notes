# Containers will not fix your broken culture and other hard truths

* Dev Advocate at Microsoft, 71 conferences this coming year speaking on Kubernetes, containers, clouds, and the like
* CS degree in 90s 'so she wouldnt have to talk to people' (surprise!)
* 'Computers are easy, people are hard' is a misnomer. *Both* are hard, but we need to work through it.

## 5 Tech Truths
* Tech is not a panacea
  * We can't solve everything that and need to ack it
* Good team interactions: build because you can't buy
  * 'any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure' -- Mel Conway
    * all comes back to communication
    * breaking changes, changes you make that affect someone else, all these need to be openly discussed
* Tech is made of people, not code
  * focus on the outcomes, not the tech itself. Community over code.
  * despite different day-to-days, people in tech are all pretty similar
  * 'in a world that celebrates pioneers, be settlers instead' -- @lady_nerd
    * lots of things are being developed, but the tech we already have is already pretty great - learn to use it well and discuss what exists
  * Need to talk through things like api boundaries, responsibilities of components of code, and the like
  * if you're going to have a distributed team, you need to distribute decision making. Central decisions won't work.
  * have more handshakes: more restatement of what the plan is, or what is about to happen so all is clear
* Good fences make good neighbors
  * build abstractions, let teams figure out what they need to build off of those abstractions and let them figure out what's best
* Avoid Sadness as a Service
  * include people in these discussions because that's what this is all about really
