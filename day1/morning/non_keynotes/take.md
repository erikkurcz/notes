* What are minimums, when are we doing code reviews, why are we doing them
* What *kind* of tests are required?
  * Unit, integration, API, db?

* What *kind* of documentation is required?
  * docstrings or html?
  * mkdocs / sphinx / readmes?
  * *When* are docs to be written? Before or after? Both?
