# Amplio

* Cliff Schmidt
  * Inspired to change something in the world in 2007
  * Felt education in developing countries was appropriate cause
* Talking Book Program / Literacy Bridge, later 'Amplio'
  * Means to transmit information to those in rural areas
  * Info on health, agriculture, etc available through it
  * Without it they might not know how to address issues like malaria, might not be using advanced farming techniques
* Challenge: most people are illiterate, villages are difficult to get to frequently
  * Not ideal to go attempt to visit and knowledge dump frequently - especially since they likely cannot take notes
  * Instead: give them device pre-loaded with everything on it, visit to add more info and / or charge batteries every so often
* Example:
  * Felix - a farmer - did an AB test on farming practices on his own
  * Just a matter of getting info to people, they can learn and apply thereafter
* User testing example
  * Switched from using directional arrows to using commonly-recognizable symbols like hands, a tree, and others
  * Found that users didn't have a word for 'right arrow' in their languages - so translators were describing in a more confusing way, such as 'there are 4 shapes on this device, they all look similar, they each have 3 points, press the one on the right to do X'
  * But much better to use their own language to describe actions tied to buttons, so they adapted to feedback
* Logs
  * Device logs user activity
  * When there is a network connection, logs are uploaded to central servers
  * Analyze and determine what's working, what's not, what to do next

# Banking on Open Source

* Myrle Krantz
* Goal: Bring banking to the underbanked
  * Ex: everyone except 1 person paid for conference in advance and with credit
  * Likewise most people took loans for *something*, but without access to a bank would've have been able to do X (e.g. college)
* Banking in rural communities --> community banks
  * Specifically open banking - open ledgers
* Effects
  * increased spending on primary education in particular
  * short term has small but compounding effects
* Creditworthiness
  * 1% write off rate
  * 3-6% delinquency rate
  * Breaks the stereotype^
* Tie back to Open source
  * Similar culture of openness, transparency, sharing ideas
  * Apache Fineract: software to support joint liability groups and savings groups
